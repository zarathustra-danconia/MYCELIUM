# MYCELIUM
Decentralized Human-Centric Social Network 


Overview:

Welcome to the MYCELIUM! Our project aims to provide users with a decentralized social media platform that utilizes technology to enable individuals manifest their full potential in the aspects of life that really matter. Health, finance, education, or social interactions, our decentralized network offers a range of tools and features to empower users in their personal growth, attempting to fix the emerging pathologies of the social networks broadly used today.

Health Dashboard: Access decentralized digital twin health records, AI healthspan dashboarding, smart actions, and visualization and gamification in areas like physical health, cognition, and mental health.
Finance Dashboard: Manage digital wallets, investments, online banking, crowdfunding, and cryptocurrency transactions (e.g., Elysium coins).
Education Dashboard: Utilize AI-enabled schooling features, gamification elements, and personalized learning experiences.
Social Networking: Enjoy all the features of a traditional social network, including curated feeds, groups, business accounts, voting mechanisms, and tokens.
Medical Providers Integration: Medical practitioners can create business accounts to offer online services, interact with patients, and manage administrative tasks.
Corporate Healthcare Integration: Gyms, sports clubs, and corporate healthcare providers can create subgroups for members/employees, enabling gamification of health and wellness activities.
Journalism: Users can engage in journalism within the network, contributing to the dissemination of information and fostering public discourse.
Decentralized Identity: Each user creates a digital avatar and digital twin, serving as a decentralized identity wallet.
